# MyHealthApp

Submitted by: **Kelly Bonilla Guzmán**

**MyHealthApp** is a simple data model for representing a patient’s chart
in an Electronic Medical Record system.

## Features

MyHealthApp supports the following functionality:
- Retrieving a patient's full name and age in years (see `Patient.swift`)
- Retrieving a patient's list of medications they are currently taking, ordered
by date prescribed, excluding any completed medications (see `Patient.swift`)
- Prescribing a new medication to a patient, while avoiding duplicating medications the patient is currently taking (see `Patient.swift`)
- Determing which donor blood types a patient can receive a blood transfusion from (see `BloodType.swift`)

## Notes
- My codebase adheres as best as possible to [Google's Swift Style Guide](https://google.github.io/swift/#line-wrapping)
